# 10. A hexagonal cell within a 4-cell system has a radius of 1.387 km. A total of 60

# Î»= call/hour, compute the following for an Erlang C system that has a 5% probability 
# of a delayed call- 
# a) How many users per square kilometer will this system support? 
# b) What is the probability that a delayed call will have to wait for more than 10s? 
# c) What is the probability that a call will be delayed for more than 10 seconds?
